Title: The GPU Overload Mystery in AI Training**

**Narrative Script:**

At NeuralVision Labs, a cutting-edge AI startup, the team was racing against time to train a new state-of-the-art computer vision model for detecting rare medical conditions. The project relied on a high-performance GPU cluster featuring the latest NVIDIA A100 cards. 

Sophia, the lead AI engineer, initiated the training pipeline for the model—a modified version of ResNet-50 with additional attention layers to improve focus on subtle image details. Initially, everything seemed fine, but after a few hours, alarms began to ring:  
*"GPU utilization dropped to 20% on Node 3. Training throughput significantly reduced."*

Sophia and her team quickly logged into the monitoring dashboard. The GPUs on Node 3 were far below expected utilization, while the other nodes remained fully utilized. A quick check of the logs revealed recurring errors:  
*"[WARNING] DataLoader Stalled: Insufficient data for batch processing."*

The team suspected a bottleneck in the data pipeline. The training dataset—a massive collection of high-resolution medical images—was stored on an external NAS (Network-Attached Storage) system. They ran a diagnostic on the storage I/O and discovered that Node 3 had significantly higher data latency than the others.

Sophia realized that the preprocessing script was dynamically resizing images on-the-fly during training. This task, coupled with high-resolution images, was overloading the NAS and causing data starvation on Node 3.

To fix the issue, Sophia preprocessed the entire dataset offline, resizing and augmenting the images ahead of time. This reduced the runtime data processing workload. After re-launching the training pipeline, the GPU utilization on Node 3 returned to 98%, matching the other nodes.

By the end of the day, the team successfully trained their model two days ahead of schedule, achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy over the previous version.
